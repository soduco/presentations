                  urban areas},
  doi =		 {10.1109/IVS.2013.6629486},
  abstract =	 {In the context of urban autonomous navigation
                  systems for going from point A to point B, a
                  practicable trajectory which takes into account
                  drivable areas and permanent obstacles should be
                  designed first. A robot should then follow this
                  trajectory while avoiding not only dynamic obstacles
                  such as cars and pedestrians but also permanent
                  obstacles such as road sides and central islands. To
                  this end, a robot must be aware of its exact
                  position and must be informed of what its immediate
                  environment is at all times. In dense urban areas,
                  GNSS systems generally suffer from lack of precision
                  due to masks and multipaths. Localization systems
                  have to model these phenomena and even merge with
                  vision based methods in order to obtain the high
                  accuracies required in the process. In this paper we
                  propose an integrated geographic database enabling,
                  on the one hand, the GNSS and vision based
                  localization methods to obtain the required
                  accuracy, and on the other, to provide the robots
                  with information about its surroundings such as
                  drivable surfaces and permanent obstacles. The
                  database is comprised of 3D buildings, 3D roads and
                  a set of 3D visual landmarks. Our system provides
                  most of the information required for autonomous
                  navigation in dense urban areas and has successfully
                  been embedded in real experiments, thanks to a
                  real-time querying system.},

                  rules described in French local urban planning
                  schemes. As these rules are only expressed in free
                  formed texts, it is difficult to assess their impact

                  rules. These rules are applied to a structured
                  geographic environment in order to automatically
                  determine and to represent their influence by 3D
                  volumes. These volumes can be use by visual
                  analytics to asses or emulate the influence of the
                  rules in terms of buildable potential or by spatial

  abstract =	 {{Modeling virtual urban environments remains a
                  complex problem. The main issuesto model such
                  environments are related to the great complexity and
                  huge amountof data they represent. In fact, this
                  amount of data is hard to store and manipulate,but
                  also to visualize and update. In this thesis, we
                  propose a better usage of a prioriknowledge on urban
                  environments. First, we present an original
                  rewriting system,FL-systems, as a functional
                  extension of L-systems, mainly used for biologically
                  basedmodeling. Terminal elements being functions,
                  FL-systems allow the real-timegeneration of
                  geometric objects. Furthermore, we propose a new
                  cache mechanismfor FL-systems in order to reuse
                  previously rewritten modules. Finally, we definea
                  new modeling method for urban environments using
                  abstraction hierarchies andsimple polygon
                  subdivision algorithms, which allows to focus the
                  modeling attentionon each level of detail of the
                  city separately.}},

  abstract =	 {{Understanding urban dynamics is an increasingly
                  important challenge that can be answered in several
                  ways. For many years, an important body of research
                  has been tackling this problem in the literature of
                  regional science, urban and economic geography,
                  geomatics and related fields. But, whatever the
                  field of research, in order to better understand
                  urban dynamics, one needs to study the actual
                  changes geographic objects undergo over
                  time. Studying such changes requires the
                  constitution of spatio-temporal databases containing
                  data for each step of the considered
                  evolutions. Unfortunately, building such
                  spatio-temporal databases from existing topographic
                  databases is a difficult process that requires
                  tracking topographic objects in consecutive
                  databases and creating links between them. The
                  evolution of topographic objects which evolution has
                  been tracked can be studied and then simulated. The
                  observed changes the geographic objects undergo help
                  up understand each topographic object's dynamics,
                  their particularities on specific geographical areas
                  as well as their evolutions in different time
                  periods. Simulations can then be used to better
                  understand the specific evolutions taking place on a
                  given territory. Eventually, such simulations might
                  be able to help the planning and policy making
                  processes. The methodology presented in this paper
                  includes the construction of spatio-temporal
                  databases, the capture of historical topographic
                  data from existing topographic maps, and a rich
                  hierarchy creation process. Finally, the bases of
                  our vector-based simulation platform are given.}},
